# Architecture

This document explains varous logical flows for how a `FASTElement` is composed, defined, rendered, and updated.

## What is FASTElement?

`FASTElement` is an extension of `HTMLElement` which makes use of Custom Element APIs native to the browser. It also supplies the following methods `compose`, `define`, and `from`.

- The `compose` method combines the Custom Element name, template, style, and other options to create the definition for the Custom Element.
- The `define` method makes use of the native Custom Element `define` to register the Custom Element with a Custom Element Registry.
- The `from` method allows the use of Custom Built-Ins so that a user does not need to define a template but can specify a native `HTMLElement` such as `HTMLButtonElement`.

## Creating a Custom Element from FASTElement

A basic developer flow for defining a custom element looks like this:

```mermaid

    A[Create a FASTElement web component by extending the FASTElement Class] --> F
    F[Compose with FASTElement.compose to include template and styles] --> G[Define the component in the browser with FASTElement.define]
```

Let's take a close look at the compose and define steps to see what the FAST architecture is doing.

## Composing a Custom Element

Using `FASTElement.compose` this creates a new `FASTElementDefinition` which includes all metadata needed for the element such as templates, attributes, styles, etc. this then registers the element with the global FAST for re-use and returns the `FASTElementDefinition` which can be referenced by `ElementController.definition`.

## A Custom Element in JavaScript sent to the Browser

Let's step back from defining the Custom Element and consider what is happening when we import from the `@microsoft/fast-element` package.

First, a global `FAST` property will be created if one does not already exist, typically in browser on the `window`.

Additionally, when Custom Elements are included in a script a few things might happen even before a Custom Element gets detected by the browser. First, there are initial side effects caused by the use of decorators. These include the `attr` and `observable` decorators made available by the `@microsoft/fast-element` package.

```mermaid

    A[The browser loads the JavaScript file containing FAST]
    A --> B[The FAST global is added]
    B --> C[Any defined observable decorators are added to the FAST global]
    A --> D[Any defined attribute decorators are attached to the constructor of the FAST Custom Element]
```

### Pre-render Template

The `html` tag template is typically used to create a `ViewTemplate` using the `ViewTemplate.create` method. This is executed and passed during the `compose` step and before `FASTElement` is instantiated.

During the `ViewTemplate.create` step, the following happens for each string:
- Factories with unique IDs are created for each tag template literal argument (or `TemplateValue`) which matches with the corresponding string
- A binding is created from the `TemplateValue`

A resulting string using `createHTML` function is created using the `HTMLDirective`, the previous string from the `html` tag template which determines the aspect if one exists, these aspects are the `@`, `:`, or other binding aspect attached to attributes. The `createHTML` returns a `Markup` attribute using the factory that has a unique ID. This is all concatenated as a string and passed to a new `ViewTemplate` with all the factories (empty until one is assigned) that act as a dictionary with the unique IDs as the key to look up each factory once it has been created.

#### HTML Binding Directives

The `HTMLBindingDirective` applies bindings to items identified as various `TemplateValue` within the `html` tag template. The `createHTML` step uses the factory associated with the binding to create strings in the markup using the factory's ID.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[A new HTMLBindingDirective is created with a data binding which has a policy, options, createObserver, and an evaluate method assigned to the passed arrow function such as x => x.foo]
    B[oneTime binding passes the corresponding tag template argument, an arrow function]
    C[oneWay binding passes a copy of the corresponding tag template argument, an arrow function]
    D[An already specified binding such as a repeat or when directive]
    A --> B
    A --> C
    A --> D
    E[When a createObserver is called, an Observable.binding is created passing the arrow function to be evaluated and the subscriber to be notified]
    C --> E
    F[When a createObserver is called, the instance of the one time binding is returned which includes a bind method returning the arrow function executed against the controller source and context]
    B --> F
```

## A Custom Element is Detected by the Browser

Because the `FASTElement` is an extension of the `HTMLElement`, it makes use of the same lifecycle hooks and extends them with `$fastController`. It also initializes using another class `ElementController`, the methods this are called during the custom elements native `constructor`, `connectedCallback`, `disconnectedCallback`, and `attributeChangedCallback` lifecycle hooks.

### ðŸ”„ **Lifecycle**: Initialization

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[A FASTElement web component is added to the DOM] --> B
    B[FASTElement initializes the ElementController.forCustomElement passing the Custom Element instance] --> C
    B --> F[Observables applied to the FASTElement are updated on the FAST global without values]
    C{Is an ElementController available?}
    C --> |yes|E
    C --> |no|D
    D[Initialize a new ElementController referred to as setting an element controller strategy]
    D --> F
    E[ElementController captures the Custom Element instance and the definition and attaches them to the $fastController which is then attached to the instance]
```

### ðŸ”„ **Lifecycle**: Component is connected

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[browser HTMLElement's connectedCallback is called] --> B
    B[this.$fastController.connect in FASTElement is called] --> C
    B --> D
    B --> E
    B --> F
    C[bind observables by capturing the Custom Elements properties and setting the values from the bound observables on the Custom Element]
    D[connect behaviors by call the connectedCallback on all behaviors]
    E[render template, execute an ElementViewTemplate's render method]
    F[add styles either as an appended StyleElement node or an adoptedStylesheet which may include and attach behaviors]
```

#### Render Template

The rendering of the template on the `ElementController` is by the `renderTemplate` method which is called during the `ElementController.connect` method which is triggered by `HTMLElement`s `connectedCallback` lifecycle.

The `renderTemplate` identifies the Custom Element, and the shadow root associated with the Custom Element. This then places a rendering of the template (an `ElementView`) onto the internal `view` of the controller. When creating the `ElementView`/`HTMLView` using the `ViewTemplate.render`, the `Compile.compile` identifies a `DocumentFragment` either by using an existing `<template>` tag, or creating one to wrap the contents of the shadow root. A new `CompilationContext` is created and the `compileAttributes` function is called, this results in the replacement of the placeholder attributes initally set-up during the pre-render step with their values if a value has been assigned. The factories with the associated nodes identified are then passed to the context. The view then binds all behaviors to the source element. The `CompilationContext.createView` is executed with the `DocumentFragment` as the root, and returns an `HTMLView`. This `HTMLView` includes an `appendTo` method to attach the fragment to the host element, which it then does. It should be noted that the compiled HTML is a `string`, which when set on the `DocumentFragment` as `innerHTML`, this allows the browser to dictate the creation of HTML nodes.

### ðŸ”„ **Lifecycle**: Component is disconnected

When a component is disconnected, a cleanup step is created to remove associated behaviors.

### ðŸ”„ **Lifecycle**: Attribute has been changed

Attributes have an `AttributeDefinition` which allows for converters, attachment of the `<attributName>Changed` aspect of the `@attr` decorator among other capabilities.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[browser HTMLElement's attributeChangedCallback is called] --> B
    B[this.$fastController.onAttributeChangedCallback in FASTElement is called] --> C
    C[calls the attribute definitions onAttributeChangedCallback method with the updated value] --> D
    D[An Updates.enqueue is called which places the update in the task queue which is then executed, these are performed async unless otherwise specified]
```

These changes are observed and similar to the way `Observables` work, they utilize an `Accessor` pattern which has a `getValue` and `setValue` in which DOM updates are applied.

### Observables are updated

The `Reflect` API is used to override `defineProperty` in order to observe a property on an Custom Element, this overrides the getter and setter, which allows subscribers to be notified of changes. Any changes which `set` the value are passed to the `Updates` queue which has been added to the FAST Global.
